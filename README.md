        ## Interaction Pattern

        Every command follows this 5-step structure:

        ```
        ① Scope Confirmation  — verify target and options with user
        ② Live Analysis       — progress bar while working
        ③ Findings Table      — structured results sorted by impact
        ④ Action Plan         — prioritised, time-boxed recommendations
        ⑤ Next Steps          — suggested follow-up commands
        ```
