        ## Overview

        This skill provides 10 production-ready commands tailored for

        ## Interaction Pattern

        Every command follows this structured response format:

        ```
        1. CONTEXT CHECK   — Verify inputs and confirm scope with user
        2. ANALYSIS        — Deep analysis with live progress display
        3. FINDINGS TABLE  — Structured results with severity / priority
        4. RECOMMENDATIONS — Prioritised action list (quick wins first)
        5. NEXT STEPS      — Suggested follow-up commands
        ```

        ## UI Conventions

        | Symbol | Meaning              |
        |--------|----------------------|
